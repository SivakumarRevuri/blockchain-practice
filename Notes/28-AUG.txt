Document Object Model(DOM) -
    => The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 
    => The name "Document Object Model" was choosen because it is an "object model" is used in the traditional object oriented design sense: documents are modeled using objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed. 
    => In other words, the nodes in the above diagram do not represent a data structure, they represent objects, which have functions and identity. 

With the document object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
    1) JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    2) JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    3) JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    4) JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    5) JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes (document.write("<p>Hello World!</p>"))
    6) JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    7) JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
